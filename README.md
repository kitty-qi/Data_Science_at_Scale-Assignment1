## Installation

Install the requirements necessary to run this project:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the project
Run the following 4 files in the Step5 folder to add flim, sport, ifHate, ifSarcasm features in combine.csv, and integrate the result into combine_after5.csv.
```
add_film.py
sarcasm_token.py
add_hatespeech.py
add_sarcasm.py
```
In MIME datasets folder, 3 MIME type.ipynb imports combine_after5.csv (Pixstory dataset with step 5 features), exports combine_final.csv (Pixstory dataset with both step 5 and 6 features), and draws graphs to answer report questions 1 and 5. Images of positive words and zip file of covid data are also in the folder.
```
3 MIME type.ipynb
```

The following script in the Step7 folder is used to convert the TSV with 95k rows into smaller batches of json files, each bacth has 100 instances.
```
split.py
```
After split, use these three files in tika-similarity to compute Jaccard, Edit-Distance, and Cosine similarity scores for each batch correspondingly.
```
jaccard_similarity.py
edit-value-similarity.py
cosine_similarity.py
```
With calculated simiarity scores, run the following files to generate circle.json, clusters.json, and levelCluster.json, which are needed for D3 visualizations.
```
edit-cosine-circle-packing.py
edit-cosine-cluster.py
generateLevelCluster.py
```

In the Q2_image_code folder, open Q2_time.ipynb will show the code to visualize feature of users' post time of a day. This is the answer towards report question 2.
```
Q2_time.ipynb
```
In the Q3_image_code folder, open Q3_genders_ages_interests.ipynb will show the code to visualize features among users' interests, genders, and ages. This is the answer towards report question 3.
```
Q3_genders_ages_interests.ipynb
```
Run the following file in the Step5 folder to draw graphs for answers in report question 4.
```
Hatespeech_Age & Gender.py
```
In the Q6_Language_Indentification folder, open Q6_Language_Indentification.ipynb will show the code to visualize users' distribution from narratives' language identification. This is the answer towards report question 6.
```
Q6_Language_Indentification.ipynb
```

## Methodology

#### Q5: Add and expand the dataset with sporting events, film festivals, flag for hate speech, and flag for sarcasm

We have the film and sports events period from film_date.txt and sport_date.txt. If a user makes a post (Account Created Date) during these periods, our columns "Film" and "Sport" will enter the name of those events from film_name.txt and sport_name.txt. 
 
We have a list of words in hatespeech.txt to help detect hate speech in our posts. If the title and narrative of the post have more than two marked words in the hatespeech.txt, this post will be flagged as hate speech and shown as "TRUE" in the "ifHate" column in our dataset. The list of words is from the ADL Hate Symbol Database.  

We have a list of 'sarcasm.txt' from the database Sarcasm_v2, and we compiled a list of 100 woords that appeared most frequently in these ironic sentences, such as you, me, etc. These commonly used words can negatively affect the similarity of two sentences. Then we removed the 100 words (buzz) for the sentence in 'scarasm.txt' to form the new document 'sarcasm_clear.txt'. Finally, we compared the title and narritive parts of each post with each sentence for 'sarcasm_clear.txt', using Levenshtein.ratio. If the similarity of a post exceeds 0.7 (the maximum is 1), it is considered containing sarcasm, and this post will be flagged as "TRUE" in the "ifSarcasm" column in our dataset.

``` 
Levenshtein.ratio
``` 

#### Q6: Identify at least three other datasets, each of different top level MIME type

Our three other datasets have following MIME types:
- image/png
> We find and download three images of positive words (pos1.png, pos2.png, pos3.png). <br>
We import Tesseract to extract text from images and compare them with narratives. We store "TRUE" or "FALSE" depending on whether posts have positive words in these three images in columns Postive Words 1, Postive Words 2, and Postive Words 3.

- application/api+json
> We use a public holiday API to find whether the date of the post is a holiday in each continent or not. We use the request library to parse API responses. (EU_holiday is shortened for Europe; AM_holiday is shortened for Americas; AS_holiday  is shortened for Asia; AF_holiday  is shortened for Africa; OC_holiday is shortened for Oceania holiday names). <br>
If the post date is a holiday, we will input the name of that holiday into its correct position in one of the following columns: Europe Holiday, Americas Holiday, Asia Holiday, Africa Holiday, and Oceania Holiday. And also, enter "TRUE" into Public Holiday Or Not. We will enter "False" into Public Holiday Or Not if it is not a holiday.

- application/zip
> We extract the zip file (owid-covid-data.zip), unzip it, and get csv file for the covid condition. It represents users' interest in health and politics. Cov_cases, cov_deaths, cov_tests, and cov_vaccinations stand for the number of cases, deaths, tests, and vaccinations in a day globally.
